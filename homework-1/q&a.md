### Answer1:

- (a) **Risk**: Potential for loss or damage from a threat.

- (b) **Threat**: Possible danger to security or functionality.

- (c) **Defect**: Imperfection in a product or process causing malfunction.

- (d) **Flaw**: Fundamental weakness in a system or design.

- (e) **Bug**: Software error causing unexpected or incorrect results.

- (f) **Vulnerability**: Security weakness exploitable by threats.

- (g) **Weakness**: Inherent limitation or deficiency in a system.

- (h) **Failure**: Inability of a system or component to perform intended function.

- (i) **Exploit**: Technique to leverage vulnerabilities for unauthorized access or damage.

- (j) **Integrity**: Assurance of data accuracy and reliability.

- (k) **Authentication**: Process of verifying identity.

- (l) **Authorization**: Granting of rights and privileges to a user.

### Answer2:

- **Five Tom Scott Videos**:

- (1): [**The Link that can crash chrome**](https://youtu.be/0fw5Cyh21TE) - The purpose of selecting this video was the tittle of it, sounded interesting and learned about how chrome computes the string and how null character is used in it.

- (2): [**Buffer Exploits and Buffer Overflow**](https://youtu.be/rE5dW3BTpn4) - Buffer exploits are one of the basic bugs of computer science. They're responsible for glitches in games, for all sorts of viruses and exploits, and any number of technical disasters.

- (3): [**The Two General's Problem**](https://youtu.be/IP-rGJKSZ3s) - How to handle identical multiple orders request on the server for food delivery apps by properly, using idempotency token.

- (4): [**Why You Should Turn On Two Factor Authentication**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGRii5f_uSc) - Something new I learned about the three factors of authentication(**something you know, something you are, something you have**) and the importance of using two factor authentication.

- (5): [**How NOT Store Passwords**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q):

- First advice given was not store the password at all, instead use google logins or third party logins and let them handle it.
- Secondly if you have to store the password then use Hash and salt.

### Answer3:

- 1. **Heartbleed**: Heartbleed is a security bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, which is a widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Discovered in 2014, it allowed attackers to read the memory of systems protected by the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL, potentially exposing sensitive data such as private keys, user passwords, and confidential information. The impact of Heartbleed was significant due to the widespread use of OpenSSL; it affected millions of websites and required a massive, coordinated response to patch systems and revoke compromised keys. The economic impact included the cost of responding to the bug, potential data breach consequences, and loss of trust in internet security.


- 2. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: XSS is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A successful XSS attack can result in unauthorized access to user data, session hijacking, and potentially more destructive actions if the compromised data has a high level of privilege. The societal impact includes the erosion of trust in web security and the potential for significant data breaches. The economic impact mainly revolves around the cost of mitigating these attacks and potential legal ramifications for compromised sites.


- 3. **Billion-Laughs**: The Billion-Laughs attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets XML parsers. The attack exploits the use of entity expansion, where a small amount of XML code is recursively expanded to consume a large amount of memory, overwhelming the parser and causing the system to crash or become unresponsive. This attack can be particularly impactful on systems that rely heavily on XML processing, causing service disruptions and requiring resources for mitigation and prevention.


- 4. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: CSRF is an attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. By exploiting the web application's trust in the user, an attacker can force the user to perform state-changing requests like transferring funds or changing an email address. The societal impact includes potential personal and financial damage to users, while the economic impact involves the cost of securing applications against CSRF attacks and potential losses due to fraudulent activities.
